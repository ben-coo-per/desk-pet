# desk-pet
Remote work can be lonely without a pet

Deskpet is (but in a much more literal way, is not yet) tamagachi-like app for your desktop. 

I'm hoping to make this into something that can rig up custom images (say a real life pet, your favorite animal, a friend, etc.) as pets & potentially "Breed" them with nearby deskpet users
